# choice-game

A deterministic, choice-driven fantasy adventure built with Streamlit.

## Quick start

1. `pip install streamlit`
2. `streamlit run app.py`

## Narrative design principles

### Delayed consequences
Delayed consequences are what make players say **"oh damn..."**.

A choice should not only change the next line of dialogue — it should echo into later scenes, changing risk, trust, and what options are still possible.

### 4. Branching narrative paths
Not just different endings:
- Different scenes
- Different characters
- Different information

If everyone sees the same middle, it’s not really branching.

### 5. Irreversible decisions
Some choices must:
- Lock out content
- Kill characters
- Permanently change the world

This creates emotional weight.

### 🎮 Player-facing essentials
### 6. Clear feedback
Players must feel the impact through:
- NPC reactions
- World changes
- Tone shifts
- New options appearing or disappearing

Never say **"this mattered"** — show it.
